# OpenAI Tools

This is a collection of little tools I use to play around with the OpenAI API's. 


## Install 

- npm install 
- or yarn 

## Tools 

###  GPT3 fine tuning 

This small tool traverses a directory and creates a JSONL file which can be used to fine tune OpenAI GPT3. 

See for more information: https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning

Make you have openai installed and in the current path, as well as the OPENAI_API_KEY in the env. 

- run  ```node fine-tune-gpt3.js``` for help
